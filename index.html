    <p>CS 499 ePortfolio (in progress)</p>

    <h2>Professional Self Assessment</h2>

<p>Over the past few years in the Computer Science program, I have learned that being “good at coding” is only one part of actually being ready for the real world. What I have gained from this program is a better understanding of how to build software in a structured way, how to think through problems with a computer science mindset, and how to communicate what I built so that other people can understand it. Building my ePortfolio in CS 499 helped me take all of that work and turn it into something that feels more professional and more connected to my career goals. Instead of having random assignments spread across classes, I now have one place that shows what I can do and how I improved over time.</p>
<p>One of the biggest strengths I developed is in software engineering and design. Throughout the program, I had to move past just getting code to run and start thinking about how to make it readable, maintainable, and user-focused. In my portfolio, my main artifact is my CS 360 Inventory App. What makes this artifact valuable to me is that it is not just a small script or a single class project; it is a working application with real features that connect together. Enhancing it across multiple categories forced me to think like a developer who has to improve an existing codebase without breaking it. I had to keep my design decisions consistent, keep the UI usable, and make sure changes in one part of the project did not create problems in another part. That experience helped me understand the importance of planning, testing, and writing code in a way that supports future changes.</p>
<p>Another area I improved in is data structures and algorithms. Earlier in my CS journey, I mostly saw algorithms as something you do on homework problems, but building the ePortfolio helped me see how they show up in real applications. Even something simple like sorting, filtering, and organizing lists becomes important when your app is meant to be used by real people. When I implemented improvements related to how inventory items are displayed and organized, I had to think about efficiency and how the app would behave if the dataset got larger. I also learned to explain my logic and tradeoffs clearly, which is just as important as writing the code itself. The point was not to do something complicated for no reason; it was to make the application more usable and to prove that I understand how algorithmic decisions affect performance and user experience.</p>
<p>My database skills grew a lot through this capstone. The inventory app depends on SQLite for persistent storage, so the database layer is not optional; it is part of the core functionality. For my database enhancement, I focused on making the schema and the data layer more professional. I strengthened the table design with clearer column meaning, better constraints, and indexing to support performance. I also implemented a real database version upgrade path instead of relying on wiping tables. That was a big learning moment because it showed me that database changes can break an entire system if you do not plan for migration and compatibility. Working through that helped me understand how database design, integrity, and scalability matter in real systems, especially if I want to work in data-focused roles in the future.</p>
<p>Collaboration and communication are another area I developed across the program, and especially in CS 499. Even though a lot of my work is individual, the capstone is designed to simulate professional expectations. The code review and narratives were basically practice for explaining your work to an audience, whether that audience is a peer, manager, or employer. I had to explain what the app does, why I chose certain enhancements, and what skills each enhancement demonstrates. I also had to keep my work organized with consistent file naming, clear documentation, and portfolio formatting that makes sense to someone who is seeing it for the first time. That is the part that feels most like “professionalization” to me, because in real jobs, you do not just turn in code, you communicate decisions and show evidence that the solution actually works.</p>
<p>Security is something I take more seriously now than I did earlier in the program. At first, I mostly thought of security as one separate class topic, but it shows up everywhere once you build real applications. In the inventory app, security connects to input validation, safe data handling, and preventing bad data from getting into the database. It also connects to permissions and protecting user information. Even when a project is not a high-risk system, having the mindset of validating data, thinking through edge cases, and designing for privacy makes the work stronger and more realistic. This capstone helped me build that habit by requiring enhancements that are more than surface-level changes and by pushing me to justify decisions using professional expectations.</p>
<p>All of my artifacts fit together because they show growth in one connected project from multiple angles. The CS 360 Inventory App is the main proof of my skills because I enhanced it in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Instead of presenting unrelated work, the portfolio shows how one application can be improved across categories the same way it would be in a real development cycle. My code review video explains the original state of the project and the plan for improvement. The enhancement narratives show what I changed and what I learned. This structure makes the ePortfolio feel cohesive, and it also makes it easier for an employer to understand what they are looking at.</p>
<p>Overall, completing this program and building this ePortfolio helped me feel more prepared to enter the computer science field because it gave me proof of what I can do and it showed me how to present myself professionally. I can now explain my work clearly, show real artifacts that demonstrate my skills, and discuss how I made improvements over time. Going forward, my goal is to keep building projects that connect to real needs, especially in areas like data and analytics, and to keep improving how I communicate technical work to different audiences. This portfolio is a strong starting point for that, and it represents the progress I have made through the Computer Science program.</p>
